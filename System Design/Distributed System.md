# Distributed System

A distributed system is a collection of seperate and independernt software/hardware components, called nodes, that are networked and work together coherently by coordincating and communicating through messages passing or events, to fulfill one end goal.

Nodes can be unstructure or highly structured, depending on the system requirements. The complexities are hidden away from the end user, making the whole system appear as one computer.
